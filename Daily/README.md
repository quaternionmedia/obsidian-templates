## Structure

### Folders
All notes are organized into folders by `Year` / `Month` to maintain a reasonable number of files per folder

### Daily
Daily notes are named with the date in [[ISO-8601]] format: `YYYY-MM-DD`

### Weekly
Weekly notes are named with the week number in  format: `YYYY-W##`

> [!note] Week numbers
> There is a difference in week numbers between [[ISO-8601]] and the US standard:
> 
> The [[ISO-8601]] standard defines the first week of the year as the week with the first Thursday in it. The [[US]] standard defines the first week of the year as the week with the first Sunday in it. 
> This means that the week number may be off by one between the two standards
>
> This project uses the [[ISO-8601]] standard for week numbering.

> [!important] First week of the year
> Since the first week of the year might start in the previous year, the week number will be named with the year it ends in, but the note will live in the folder for the year and month it starts in.
> 
> E.g: in 2025, the first week of the year starts on December 29, 2024. The note will be named `2025-W01` but will live in the `2024/12` folder.

### Monthly
Monthly notes are named with the month name and year: `YYYY-MM`
